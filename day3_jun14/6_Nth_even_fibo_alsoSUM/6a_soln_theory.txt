every third number in sequence is even and the sequence of even numbers follow following recursive formula.

Recurrence for Even Fibonacci sequence is:
     EFn = 4EFn-1 + EFn-2
with seed values
     EF0 = 0 and EF1 = 2.

EFn represents n'th term in Even Fibonacci sequence.
How does above formula work?
Let us take a look original Fibonacci Formula and write it in the form of Fn-3 and Fn-6 because of the fact that every third Fibinacci number is even.

Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 [Expanding both terms]
   = Fn-2 + Fn-3 + Fn-3 + Fn-4 
   = Fn-2 + 2Fn-3 + Fn-4 [Expending first term]
   = Fn-3 + Fn-4 + 2Fn-3 + Fn-4
   = 3Fn-3 + 2Fn-4  [Expending one Fn-4]
   = 3Fn-3 + Fn-4 + Fn-5 + Fn-6 [Combing Fn-4 and Fn-5]
   = 4Fn-3 + Fn-6  

Since every third Fibonacci Number is even, So if Fn is 
even then Fn-3 is even and Fn-6 is also even. Let Fn be
xth even element and mark it as EFx.
If Fn is EFx, then Fn-3 is previous even number i.e. EFx-1
and Fn-6 is previous of EFx-1 i.e. EFx-2
So
Fn = 4Fn-3 + Fn-6
which means,
EFx = 4EFx-1 + EFx-2
